kb_kaiju::kb_kaijuClient

=head1 DESCRIPTION


A KBase module: kb_kaiju
This SDK module is developed to wrap the open source package Kaiju
determines taxonomic structure for microbial communities from shotgun metagenomic sequence data

Module also utilizes Krona for visualization of results

** The workspace object refs are of form:
**
**    objects = ws.get_objects([{'ref': params['workspace_id']+'/'+params['obj_name']}])
**
** "ref" means the entire name combining the workspace id and the object name
** "id" is a numerical identifier of the workspace or object, and should just be used for workspace
** "name" is a string identifier of a workspace or object.  This is received from Narrative.
